    <h1>What do you do for yourself!?!</h1>
    <p>Welcome!! I hope you are doing good! Consider me as your well wisher, someone who wants you to live your life until you are alive. I just want to ask you only one question: What do you do for your living!?!</p>
    <p>Some of you may say that you are a Engineer, some may say that you are the business head of xxx company, some, you are the face of the company.... but, but, but...... </p>
    <p>You need to understand the question... WHAT DO YOU DO FOR LIVING!?! NOT WHAT DO YOU DO FOR FOOD!?!</p>
    <p>Some of you may say the same answer again, I'm happy for them! but a majority of you would say, is this question valid!?! Let me ask you again, WHAT DO YOU DO FOR LIVING?!?!</p>\
    <p> Now some of you will have some idea about what I'm speaking: some will say: "I do Music", "I dance", "I drink, and smoke!!", "I read books!" , "I play games.."etc, etc, etc... "I flirt" (valid scenario right!! :P)</p>
    <p>I would say everyone's right! I Travel for Living! and also Yes i have a beautiful Job as an IT engineer!, I've built apps, websites for my clients! and that doesnt mean that I don't love my job! I love my job!!</p><Link to="/page-2/">Go to page 2</Link>
